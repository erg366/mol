Western modernity separated death from life, so death became largely invisible. The dying were removed to a hospital, nursing home or other institution, even if many of the preceding months had been spent in the person's own home, which could mean a care home or other kind of supported living. From the nineteenth century, fewer dead bodies were buried in the churchyard through which villagers regularly walked to worship; increasing numbers were taken to an out of town cemetery or crematorium. Bodies thus moed from the community's heart to its periphery. Mourners' experience of separation and invisibility has been a bit more complex.
